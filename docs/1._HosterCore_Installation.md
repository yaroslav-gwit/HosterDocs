# 1. Hoster Installation

## Install project requirements

Login as root and install `bash`, `curl` and `tmux`

```shell
sudo su -
pkg update && pkg install -y bash curl tmux netdata node_exporter prometheus
service netdata enable
service node_exporter enable
service prometheus enable
chsh -s `which bash`
```

## Log out and log back in

We've set `bash` as our new default shell. This requires us to log out and log back in, or simply execute:

```shell
bash
```

## Set environment variables

This step is optional but highly recommended. Essentially, if you ignore to set any of these values - they will be set for you automatically.

```shell
export DEF_NETWORK_NAME=internal
export DEF_NETWORK_BR_ADDR=10.0.103.254
export DEF_NETWORK_SUBNET=10.0.103.0/24
export DEF_NETWORK_RANGE_START=10.0.103.10
export DEF_NETWORK_RANGE_END=10.0.103.200
export DEF_PUBLIC_INTERFACE=bge0
export DEF_UPSTREAM_DNS_SERVER=192.168.10.254
```

Set the ZFS encryption password (will be generated automatically, if you don't)

```shell
export DEF_ZFS_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD="SuperSecretRandom_password"
```

## Execute node initialization script

This script will download and execute the installation script.

```shell
curl -S https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yaroslav-gwit/HosterCore/main/node_init.sh | bash
```

At the end of the installation you will receive a following message:

â”‚                                                                            â”‚
â”‚  zfs mount -a -l                                                           â”‚
â”‚  hoster init                                                               â”‚
â”‚                                                                            â”‚

SuperSecretRandom_password
```

At this point take a minute and save the ZFS encryption password, otherwise you'll lose access to the encrypted dataset!

## Reboot

Reboot the system, and once the it's back up online run `hoster init` to load any missing kernel modules or services:

## Initialize `Hoster`

`hoster init` has to be executed after every reboot, as it will try to load all missing kernel modules, and start all internal services (`dns_server`, `node_exporter_custom`, `traefik`, etc)

```shell
hoster init
```

## Mount encrypted ZFS datasets

Mount your encrypted ZFS dataset (also has to be executed after every reboot):

```shell
zfs mount -a -l
```

## Deploy your first VM

### Download `debian12` image

Download your first Linux based image to start the virtualization journey with `Hoster`:

```shell
hoster image download debian12
```

Execute `hoster image` to list the available images:

```text
hoster image

# EXAMPLE OUTPUT
ðŸ”— OS Images available on the public server: https://images.yari.pw/
 almalinux8
 rockylinux8
 ubuntu2004
 ubuntu2204
 debian11
 debian12
```

### Now you can finally deploy your VM

If you don't give any flags `Hoster` will deploy a VM named `test-vm-1`, using `debian11` template. This is useful for rapid deployment and testing of any kind.

```shell
hoster vm deploy
```

But you also have the ability to specify the VM name, number of CPU cores, the amount of RAM, and if you'd like to start the VM right away:

```shell
hoster vm deploy -n newAwesomeVmName -c 1 -r 1G --start-now
```

or with long flags

```shell
hoster vm deploy --name newAwesomeVmName --cpu-cores 2 --ram 2G --start-now
```

### Windows VMs support

Most of the time, Windows images prepared using our documentation work fine under `Hoster`, but just in case you have issues with the default storage driver (`nvme` in our case), then `ahci-hd` might be a good fallback.

```json
{
    "disk_type": "ahci-hd",
    "disk_location": "internal",
    "disk_image": "disk0.img",
    "comment": "OS Drive"
},
```
