# 2. Start the HA server

> Please keep in mind that plain HTTP should only be used for testing and debugging. It can be intercepted and modified on the fly to DDoS your cluster, cause server reboots, and lock up the whole HA system which will require a lot of work to revert back to a normal state. Always use some kind of encryption and avoid plain HTTP in production.

## Debug mode

To start the HA server in a debug mode, execute the command below:

```shell
hoster api start --ha-mode --ha-debug
```

Debug mode gives us the ability to test the HA within our current deployment:

- Is the network connection stable enough to support HA?
- Are the servers behaving in a predictable manner?
- Would there be enough disk and network bandwidth to support the replication and HA at the same time?
- Etc

In the debug mode we can answer all these questions, because any action that would have been applied in the production cluster, would be simply logged instead of the immediate execution:

- HA watchdog will gracefully exit, and not reboot the system if `hoster_rest_api` service has crashed
- HA cluster manager will log the cluster failover actions, and not execute them (failing over the VMs from an offline host to a healthy host)
- Etc

Check the HA logs:

```shell
tail -f /var/log/messages
```

It will give you an overview of what currently happens in the cluster:

```log

```

Check the API logs:

```shell
hoster api show-log
```

It will give you an overview of the latest API endpoint connections (usually `/api/v1/ha/ping` and `/api/v1/ha/register` when it comes to HA):

## Production mode

After observing the `debug` mode for some period of time, you can move to production (if no issues were found in the process, of course):

```shell
hoster api start --ha-mode
```

You can still view the same logs, and observe the changes in the cluster that way, but now if there are any issues spotted - a problematic node will be fenced from the rest of the cluster (rebooted, and waiting for manual interaction from you, to add it back to the cluster), and VMs/Jails will be automatically migrated to other (healthy) members.
